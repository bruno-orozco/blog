This warning has been showing up in the Vercel build logs for my Habit Tracker app I've been working on:

```
1:38  Warning: Unexpected any. Specify a different type.  @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
```

The refers to the helper function that computes the totals of each habit to be displayed in the table
footer.

```javascript
export function returnTotal(records: any[] | undefined, habit: string) {
  return records?.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
    return accumulator + currentValue[habit];
  }, 0);
}
```

I have an existing type for records called `RecordType`

```javascript
export interface RecordType {
  date: string;
  dateAsNumber: number;
  jacks: number;
  meditation: number;
  pullups: number;
  pushups: number;
  situps: number;
  stairs: number;
}
```

So I can just type that parameter like this

```javascript
records: RecordType[]
```

As soon as I do that though, I get

```console
TS7053: Element implicitly has an any type because expression of type string can't be used to index type RecordType
No index signature with a parameter of type string was found on type RecordType
```

which refers to the `currentValue[habit]` expression in the return statement.

This took a little while to figure out, but eventually I learned (or possibly relearned) that you have to do
something special in TypeScript when dynamically accessing Object properties. TypeScript doesn't just let you use
a parameter with type `string` to index your Object. You need to come up with something that has the `keyof` type.

With the help of this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.
com/questions/62438346/how-to-dynamically-access-object-property-in-typescript), I refactored to:

```javascript
export function returnTotal(records: RecordType[] | undefined, habit: string) {
    return records?.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
        return accumulator + currentValue[habit as keyof typeof currentValue];
    }, 0);
}
```

Which yields one more TS error:

```
TS2365: Operator + cannot be applied to types number and string | number
```

pointing to `accumulator + currentValue[habit as keyof typeof currentValue]` in the return. This is because the
RecordType has one property of type string.

Refactoring that line to

```javascript
accumulator + (currentValue[habit as keyof typeof currentValue] as number)
```

clears the final TS error and the build warning is gone.

Final working function:

```javascript
export function returnTotal(records: RecordType[], habit: string) {
  return records?.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
    return accumulator + (currentValue[habit as keyof typeof currentValue] as number);
  }, 0);
}
```

This was a great little exercise in dealing with Object and TypeScript errors.

Update:

Shortly after publishing this, Justin from [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/) read this and provided a
refactor to help drop the usage of the `as` keyword, which is problematic. I really like how
`CountableHabits` strips out the properties that I don't want to count and TypeScript can't count. It makes for a concise final solution. Thanks
Justin!

```javascript
type CountableHabits = Omit<RecordType, "date" | "dateAsNumber">;

export function returnTotal(records: RecordType[], habit: keyof CountableHabits) {
  return records?.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
    return accumulator + currentValue[habit];
  }, 0);
}
```
