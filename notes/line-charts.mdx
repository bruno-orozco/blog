Last month I showed my Habit Tracker to some work colleagues. I got some good
feedback that it would be helpful to see the data in a different format.

I researched options for data visualization libraries. The [D3](https://d3js.org/) library
seemed powerful but possibly overkill for my needs. I took a look at the
component library I'm currently using and it turns out they recently came out
with [Mantine Line Charts](https://mantine.dev/charts/line-chart/).

All I needed to do was upgrade to Mantine v7 and I could use those charts.
[29 commits](https://github.com/blentz100/brendanlentz.com/pull/5)
later and I had some decent looking line charts.

The mobile version wasn't looking great.

Mantine has a nice way to deal with this. The `cols` prop supports [responsive
values](https://mantine.dev/core/simple-grid/#responsive-props).

```javascript
<SimpleGrid cols={{ base: 1, sm: 2, md: 3 }}>
  <HabitLineChart records={staticRecords2024} habit={"pushups"} habitDisplayName={"Pushups"} goal={10000} />
  <HabitLineChart records={staticRecords2024} habit={"situps"} habitDisplayName={"Situps"} goal={7000} />
  <HabitLineChart records={staticRecords2024} habit={"jacks"} habitDisplayName={"Jumping Jacks"} goal={14000} />
  <HabitLineChart records={staticRecords2024} habit={"stairs"} habitDisplayName={"Stairs"} goal={200} />
  <HabitLineChart records={staticRecords2024} habit={"pullups"} habitDisplayName={"Pullups"} goal={600} />
</SimpleGrid>
```

With that in place, the mobile view now stacks each line chart on top of each
other.

  height="333"
  alt="responsive habit tracker"
  priority

I really like the new way of viewing the data. At a glance I can tell where
things stand with each habit. It's already changed the way I'm approaching
meeting each goal.

It turns out Mantine Line Charts is built on top of [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) which apparently
is built on top of D3. So I guess I went with D3 anyway.

Side question that came up while writing this post - how do you go about
resizing images when bringing them into markdown? I've been bringing them in
in their original size and then adjusting the height and width using the
`height` and `width` props inside the Image component. That requires using some
kind of [aspect ratio calculator](https://red-route.org/code/image-resizing-calculator)
to keep the image from getting distorted. It seems like a tedious way to do
it, what's your strategy?
